# RISK-RETURN ANALYSIS

In this repository, I have prepared a Jupyter Lab Notebook containing data analysis and visualizations of the risk and return metrics for four major hedge funds: **Berkshire Hathaway**, **Paulson & CO**, **Soros Fund Management**, and **Tiger Global**, measured against the **S&P 500** Exchange. Using quantative analysis, the following elements are analyzed:

1. Performance

2. Volatility

3. Risk

4. Risk-Return Profile

5. Portfolio Diversification

The following calculations will be used to analyze the data:

1. Percent Change

2. Cumulative Returns

3. Standard Deviation 

4. Annualized Standard Deviation

5. Sharpe Ratio

6. Rolling Window Metrics (Variance, Covariance, Beta, Standard Deviation)

Using these comprehensive analysis techniques, the formulas needed to quantify them, and Pandas plots to visualize them, this code will determine which Hedge Fund portfolio to include in the firm's suite of fund offerings.

## TECHNOLOGIES

In order for this trading technique to be properly plotted, there are installations required. They are the following:

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - Enables the user to use the powerful Python programming language.

[JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) - Access to the web-based IDE JupyterLab.  

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Grants access to the open-source Pandas data analysis tool, which is powered by Python.

[Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel) - Enables the user to read compiled crypto data.

## USAGE

In order to execute and plot this code, you must run the following:

```python
risk_return_analysis.ipynb
whale_navs.csv
import pandas as pd
from pathlib import path
import numpy as np
%matplotlib inline
```
Accessing JupyterLab in Bash: 

`Jupyter Lab`
